<h2 id="1">Rupin Pass Trek: </h2>	
<p>
If there is a classic trek in India, it has to be the Rupin Pass. This trek is like an orchestra building up momentum with surprises in scenery every hour or so. With every step, the trek throws up a new vista to see, a new scenery to unfold. All along, to complement the scenery, the blue waters of the Rupin runs along, sometimes rushing, at times gliding by. It culminates in the famous three stage water fall of the Rupin. In the higher reaches the trek passes through superb snow fields. The pass crossing through an echoing snow filled gully is an adrenaline high. The Rupin Pass trek has got it all: hanging villages, terrific forests, glacial meadows, hundreds of water falls and a gushing pass crossing. As a complete experience Rupin is the trek to do.

Rupin pass is the ideal trek for someone who is fit and looking for a challenging trek. The trek has lots to offer – quaint himalayan villages, towering cliffs, dark and dense forests, 3 days of trekking on snow, a thrilling gully climb, unforgettable snow slides. In short an adventure of a lifetime. It is very important that you prepare your body physically and come for the trek. While we recommend the trek for those who have prior high altitude trekking experience, fitness holds the key to successfully trekking Rupin Pass .

Rupin Pass is rated as a difficult trek. On an average you trek 5-6 hour and 10 kms every day. You have to be well prepared to be able to cover this distance with ease. Terrain is another factor which determines difficulty. Trails are not very well defined at several sections. Ascents and descents on slippery mud, scree and hard snow are a part of the trek. The climb to Rati Pheri from Upper water fall and the steep ascent to Rupin Pass through the gully at 15,000 ft.


Best Season: May - June
Difficulty Level: Difficult to Challenging
Max. Elevation: 4655 m

	<h2 id = "2">Chadar Trek:</h2>
	<p>
	 
	The beautiful Ladakh district is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country. With snowy mountain peaks and picturesque landscape, Ladakh attracts innumerable tourists from all over the country and world. It is also a popular trekking destination.

	One of the few ways to reach these snowbound villages is by trekking over frozen rivers. The Chadar trek, Leh is one such experience. Trekking along the Zanskar River, which offers a frozen path, takes you through such villages. This route has served as a trade and transportation route for several years now. Today, it is a popular trekking destination and attracts trekking enthusiasts from all over the world.


	During the trek, you will have to be very careful. You may have to walk on very thin strips of ice, bounded by canyon walls on one side and swift flowing icy water on the other side. One mistake and you may be washed below the ice. So it is very important that you take care of yourself.

	The trek usually lasts for a week and you will have to sleep in nearby caves during the night hours. The Chadar trek is unique and adventurous. It is perfect for those who love a little peril with their adventure. The beautiful snow covered landscape of Ladakh and the chilly and slippery chadar of snow beneath your feet as your trek over the frozen Zanskaar River will be an experience that you will never forget in your life.

	<h2 id = "3">Roopkund Trek:</h2>
	<p>
	The Roopkund Lake is situated high up in the Garhwal Mountains in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand. This lake is of much historical and religious importance. It was also called the Mystery or Skeletal Lake after a large number of human skeletons were found in it in 1942 by a Forest Officer.

	Following this discovery, a number of scientists visited the lake to find out the reason for the skeletons being there and it was eventually concluded that the skeletons belonged to some pilgrims who were caught unawares in a flash hailstorm.

	The trek to Roopkund Lake showcases the best of Himalayan beauty. The trek begins at Lohajung, which is situated at an elevation of 3200 metres and goes on for five days till you reach the lake, which is at an altitude of 5000 metres. The first couple of days will take you through beautiful villages, forests, rivers and Bugyals.

	The air will get thinner and thinner as you ascend and gain altitude. So it is very important that you are in the best of health and fitness when you set out for this trek. Higher energy levels will allow you to adjust better with the changing environment and enjoy the views offered by the region.

	<h2 id = "4">Stok Kangri Trek:</h2>
	<p> 
	 Stok Kangri, Ladakh is one of the most popular places for high altitude trekking in India. Although the beauty of Ladakh draws in innumerable tourists and trekkers from all over the country and the world, the Stok Kangri trek isn’t really suited for anyone and everyone.

	 It is advisable that only experienced trekkers set out on this expedition as the climatic and geographical conditions of the place may not suit novice or amateur trekkers. Nonetheless, Stok Kangri is one of the most beautiful tourist destinations in the country. It is for this reason that the Stok Kangri trek forms an inevitable experience while trekking in India.

	 The trek usually lasts for a maximum of ten days. The trek begins from Leh, which is noted for its natural beauty and warm and hospitable people. During the first couple of days of the trek, you can move around Leh, go sightseeing and get acclimatized to the weather of the region. These couple of days will prepare you for the trek ahead. You will next be taken to Chang Ma via Stok Village by road.
	

	During the trek, you will be able to view some very beautiful peaks such as the Gulap Kangri, Parcha Kangri, etc. The base camp of the trek is at an elevation of 16, 300 feet. From here, the journey continues till you reach the Stok Kangri. The view from the Stok Kangri is simply amazing. This rewarding feeling is what draws trekkers from all over the world to high altitude trekking in India.

	<h2 id = "5">The Kuari Pass Trek:</h2>
	<p>
	It was Lord Curzon’s initiative which led to the discovery of the trekking trail to Kuari Pass. The Kuari peak stands at an altitude of 4,264 metres and can be reached through a trekking trail that starts from Joshimath. The region has some of the grandest mountains of the Himalayan range namely, the Kamet (7756 m), the Chaukhamba (7128 m), the Trishul (7120 m), the Nanda Devi (7817 m) and the Nanda Devi East (7434 m).

During these walks, you can get to know more about the culture and traditions of the people here.
